Discussed checkin w/JH 

Chatted about the style of interactive learning materials for in person and online workshops. 

-Play and delight a key element to consider in the creation of materials.  

- Short videos maybe? Interactive code maybe? 

- Making the play central to the learning objectives. 

- What would make young women stay with coding over time? 

- Creativity and openness as an underlying theme of all materials 

- Games with subject matter often not talked about in cultural objects 


For next week: 

1. Saskia to establish a set of goals for residency 
2. Saskia to research available materials for P5/Processing learning
3. Phoenix to ask NPT, Playful Arts, CC Amsterdam, Resonate, Convergence, and A maze if workshops are possible
