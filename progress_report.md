- Short videos maybe? Interactive code maybe?

- Making the play central to the learning objectives.

- What would make young women stay with coding over time?

- Creativity and openness as an underlying theme of all materials

- Games with subject matter often not talked about in cultural objects

* Survey for how students who took CLF classes are still learning code or making games and what resources they reference

# March 17th

* bring in 3 specific examples of physical examples for variables and functions.
Algorithmic dance
* We need get up a form for Now Play This by Monday -
* Creation of a class preplan kit for students for NPT
* we see raising comfort level of students at the start of the class as a confidence booster. We are developing ice breaking activities

* build up a resource bank online for post class
* We are still developing survey for where people are now
* publish data as medium post and paper
what concepts were hard to understand? where are you now.
* image bank for when coding

To do list
1. Write up survey for pre-attendance for NPT (Saskia & Phoenix) and promote it
2. Write up the survey for former students (Saskia & Phoenix) and promote it
3. Show 3 physical ideas for functions using dance (Saskia)
